# Hirsipuu

Hirsipuu is a simple command-line game written in Go. It's based on the classic Finnish word game I played in elementary school, aka 'Hangman'.

I created this project to practice Go fundamentals on my own, without the help of AI. The goal was to make something fun and simple while learning the basics of the language.

## How to Play

- Run the game in your terminal:
```go run main.go
```
or 

```./hirsipuu
```
- Guess the hidden Finnish word by suggesting letters.
- Try to guess the word before you run out of attempts!
- You can customize the word list by editing the `words.txt` file.

## Files

- `main.go` — The main game logic
- `words.txt` — List of Finnish words used in the game

Enjoy playing and learning!
